1.Difference between ‘this’ and ‘let’ and when to use what, explain with examples.

both keyword (this and let) behaves differently. 

this: this keyword can be use to refer to current instance of class. Accessing private method from within class.
this keyword used to differentiate between class variables and parameters of same name(Ambiguity sitution)
 
while creating extension method.
Extension method : public static string Extension(this string str1)-- by this keyword we can identify that its extension method.

Example:
class Student

    {

        public string name, city

        public long mark = 200;

        public User(string name, string city)

        {
            this.name = name;

            this.location = location;

        }

        public void GetStuDetails()

        {

            Console.WriteLine("Name: {0}", name);

            Console.WriteLine("City: {0}", location);

            Console.WriteLine("Marks: {0}", Test.GetPercentage(this));

        }

    }

    class Test

    {

        public static double GetPercentage(Student st)

        {

            double s = ((double)200/ 600) * 100;

            return (s);

        }

    } 

    class Program

    {

        static void Main(string[] args)

        {
            Student st = new Student ("Suraj", "ranchi" )  
	st.GetStuDetails();

        }

    }
}


let keyords: we can use let keyword in LINQ, to declare variable and store data in that variable inside LINQ query.
example :
var stu=from student in st.Student let Uniqueid= student.StudentId+student.StudentName
	select new GetDetails
{
StudentName=student.StudentName
StudentUniqueId = Uniqueid
}
